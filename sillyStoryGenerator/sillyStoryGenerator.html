    <p class="story" style="visibility: invisible;">It was 94 fahrenheit outside, so Father Christmas went for a walk. When
      they got to the soup kitchen, they stared in horror for a few moments, then melted into a puddle on the sidewalk. Bob
      saw the whole thing, but was not surprised â€” Father Christmas weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day.</p>
