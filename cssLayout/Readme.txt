The display property is being used for showing, hiding, or positioning HTML elements in our layout. Every HTML element has a default display behavior and without understanding the logic behind it, you will have difficulties while working with CSS.
There is also a newer option of the display property called flex, which we use for building Flexbox layouts, and flex also provides an easier way for positioning elements.
