  The display property is being used for showing, hiding, or positioning HTML elements in our layout. Every HTML element has a default display behavior and without understanding the logic behind it, you will have difficulties while working with CSS.
  There is also a newer option of the display property called flex, which we use for building Flexbox layouts, and flex also provides an easier way for positioning elements.

Overview over display layouts:
  Normal flow
  - Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.
  The display property
  - In addition to being able to change the default presentation by turning an item from block to inline 
  and vice versa, there are some more involved layout methods that start out as a value of display. 
  However, when using these you will generally need to invoke additional properties. 
  The two values most important for our discussion of layout are display: flex and display: grid.
  The position property
  - Allows you to precisely control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. static positioning 
  is the default in normal flow.
  Floats 
  - Applying a float value such as left can cause block-level elements to wrap along one side of an element, 
  like the way images sometimes have text floating around them in magazine layouts.
  Multi-column layout
  - The Multi-column layout properties can cause the content of a block to layout in columns, 
  as you might see in a newspaper.
